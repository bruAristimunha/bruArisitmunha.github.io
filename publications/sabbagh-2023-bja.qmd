## Summary

(reprinted from the published abstract.)

### Background
Electroencephalography (EEG) is increasingly used for monitoring the depth of general anaesthesia, but EEG data from general anaesthesia monitoring are rarely reused for research. Here, we explored repurposing EEG monitoring from general anaesthesia for brain-age modelling using machine learning. We hypothesised that brain age estimated from EEG during general anaesthesia is associated with perioperative risk.

### Methods
We reanalysed four-electrode EEGs of 323 patients under stable propofol or sevoflurane anaesthesia to study four EEG signatures (95% of EEG power <8–13 Hz) for age prediction: total power, alpha-band power (8–13 Hz), power spectrum, and spatial patterns in frequency bands. We constructed age-prediction models from EEGs of a healthy reference group (ASA 1 or 2) during propofol anaesthesia. Although all signatures were informative, state-of-the-art age-prediction performance was unlocked by parsing spatial patterns across electrodes along the entire power spectrum (mean absolute error=8.2 yr; R2=0.65).

### Results
Clinical exploration in ASA 1 or 2 patients revealed that brain age was positively correlated with intraoperative burst suppression, a risk factor for general anaesthesia complications. Surprisingly, brain age was negatively correlated with burst suppression in patients with higher ASA scores, suggesting hidden confounders. Secondary analyses revealed that age-related EEG signatures were specific to propofol anaesthesia, reflected by limited model generalisation to anaesthesia maintained with sevoflurane.

### Conclusions
Although EEG from general anaesthesia may enable state-of-the-art age prediction, differences between anaesthetic drugs can impact the effectiveness and validity of brain-age models. To unleash the dormant potential of EEG monitoring for clinical research, larger datasets from heterogeneous populations with precisely documented drug dosage will be essential.
