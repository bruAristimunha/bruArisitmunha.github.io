    "section": "Summary",
    "text": "Summary\n(from bioRxiv abstract)\nEEG is an established method for quantifying large-scale neuronal dynamics which enables diverse real-world biomedical applications including brain-computer interfaces, epilepsy monitoring and sleep staging. Advances in sensor technology have freed EEG from traditional laboratory settings, making low-cost ambulatory or at-home assessments of brain function possible. While ecologically valid brain assessments are becoming more practical, the impact of their reduced spatial resolution and susceptibility to noise remain to be investigated. This study set out to explore the potential of at-home EEG assessments for biomarker discovery using the brain age framework and four-channel consumer EEG data. We analyzed recordings from more than 5200 human subjects (18-81 years) during meditation and sleep, focusing on the age prediction task. With cross-validated R2 scores between 0.3 - 0.5, prediction performance was within the range of results obtained by recent benchmarks focused on laboratory-grade EEG. While age prediction was successful from both meditation and sleep recordings, the latter led to higher performance. Analysis by sleep stage uncovered that N2-N3 stages contained most of the signal. When combined, EEG features extracted from all sleep stages gave the best performance, suggesting that the entire night of sleep contains valuable age-related information. Furthermore, model comparisons suggested that information was spread out across electrodes and frequencies, supporting the use of multivariate modeling approaches. Thanks to our unique dataset of longitudinal repeat sessions spanning 153 to 529 days from eight subjects, we finally evaluated the variability of EEG-based age predictions, showing that they reflect both trait- and state-like information. Overall, our results demonstrate that state-of-the-art machine learning approaches based on age prediction can be readily applied to real-world EEG recordings obtained during at-home sleep and meditation practice."

    "text": "Summary\n(reprinted from the published abstract.)\n\nBackground and purpose\nData from neuro-imaging techniques allow us to estimate a brain’s age. Brain age is easily interpretable as ‘how old the brain looks’ and could therefore be an attractive communication tool for brain health in clinical practice. This study aimed to investigate its clinical utility by investigating the relationship between brain age and cognitive performance in multiple sclerosis (MS).\n\n\nMethods\nA linear regression model was trained to predict age from brain magnetic resonance imaging volumetric features and sex in a healthy control dataset (HC_train, n = 1673). This model was used to predict brain age in two test sets: HC_test (n = 50) and MS_test (n = 201). Brain-predicted age difference (BPAD) was calculated as BPAD = brain age minus chronological age. Cognitive performance was assessed by the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT).\n\n\nResults\nBrain age was significantly related to SDMT scores in the MS_test dataset (r = −0.46, p &lt; 0.001) and contributed uniquely to variance in SDMT beyond chronological age, reflected by a significant correlation between BPAD and SDMT (r = −0.24, p &lt; 0.001) and a significant weight (−0.25, p = 0.002) in a multivariate regression equation with age.\n\n\nConclusions\nBrain age is a candidate biomarker for cognitive dysfunction in MS and an easy to grasp metric for brain health."

    "section": "Summary",
    "text": "Summary\n(reprinted from the published abstract.)\nPrevious literature has focused on predicting a diagnostic label from structural brain imaging. Since subtle changes in the brain precede a cognitive decline in healthy and pathological aging, our study predicts future decline as a continuous trajectory instead. Here, we tested whether baseline multimodal neuroimaging data improve the prediction of future cognitive decline in healthy and pathological aging. Nonbrain data (demographics, clinical, and neuropsychological scores), structural MRI, and functional connectivity data from OASIS-3 (N = 662; age = 46–96 years) were entered into cross-validated multitarget random forest models to predict future cognitive decline (measured by CDR and MMSE), on average 5.8 years into the future. The analysis was preregistered, and all analysis code is publicly available. Combining non-brain with structural data improved the continuous prediction of future cognitive decline (best test-set performance: R2 = 0.42). Cognitive performance, daily functioning, and subcortical volume drove the performance of our model. Including functional connectivity did not improve predictive accuracy. In the future, the prognosis of age-related cognitive decline may enable earlier and more effective individualized cognitive, pharmacological, and behavioral interventions."

    "section": "Summary",
    "text": "Summary\n(reprinted from the article: “bigger picture”)\nMagnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (M/EEG) can reveal neuronal dynamics non-invasively in real-time and are therefore appreciated methods in medicine and neuroscience. Recent advances in modeling brain-behavior relationships have highlighted the effectiveness of Riemannian geometry for summarizing the spatially correlated time-series from M/EEG in terms of their covariance. However, after artefact-suppression, M/EEG data is often rank deficient which limits the application of Riemannian concepts. In this article, we focus on the task of regression with rank-reduced covariance matrices. We study two Riemannian approaches that vectorize the M/EEG covariance between sensors through projection into a tangent space. The Wasserstein distance readily applies to rank-reduced data but lacks affine-invariance. This can be overcome by finding a common subspace in which the covariance matrices are full rank, enabling the affine-invariant geometric distance. We investigated the implications of these two approaches in synthetic generative models, which allowed us to control estimation bias of a linear model for prediction. We show that Wasserstein and geometric distances allow perfect out-of-sample prediction on the generative models. We then evaluated the methods on real data with regard to their effectiveness in predicting age from M/EEG covariance matrices. The findings suggest that the data-driven Riemannian methods outperform different sensor-space estimators and that they get close to the performance of biophysics-driven source-localization model that requires MRI acquisitions and tedious data processing. Our study suggests that the proposed Riemannian methods can serve as fundamental building-blocks for automated large-scale analysis of M/EEG."

    "section": "Summary",
    "text": "Summary\n(from bioRxiv abstract)\nNeuroscience studies face challenges in gathering large datasets, which limits the use of machine learning (ML) approaches. One possible solution is to incorporate additional data from large public datasets; however, data collected in different contexts often exhibit systematic differences called dataset shifts. Various factors, e.g., site, device type, experimental protocol, or social characteristics, can lead to substantial divergence of brain signals that can hinder the success of ML across datasets. In this work, we focus on dataset shifts in recordings of brain activity using MEG and EEG. State-of-the-art predictive approaches on M/EEG signals classically represent the data by covariance matrices. Model-based dataset alignment methods can leverage the geometry of covariance matrices, leading to three steps: recentering, re-scaling, and rotation correction. This work explains theoretically how differences in brain activity, anatomy, or device configuration lead to certain shifts in data covariances. Using controlled simulations, the different alignment methods are evaluated. Their practical relevance is evaluated for brain age prediction on one MEG dataset (Cam-CAN, n=646) and two EEG datasets (TUAB, n=1385; LEMON, n=213). When the target sample included recordings from the same subjects with a different task among the same dataset, paired rotation correction was essential (Embedded Image (rest-passive) or +0.17 (rest-smt)). When the target dataset included new subjects and a new task, re-centering led to improved performance (Embedded Image for rest-passive, Embedded Image for rest-smt). For generalization to an independent dataset sampled from a different population and recorded with a different device, re-centering was necessary to achieve brain age prediction performance close to within domain prediction performance. This study demonstrates that the generalization of M/EEG-based regression models across datasets can be substantially enhanced by applying domain adaptation procedures that can statistically harmonize diverse datasets."

    "section": "Summary",
    "text": "Summary\n(reprinted from the published abstract.)\n\nBackground\nElectroencephalography (EEG) is increasingly used for monitoring the depth of general anaesthesia, but EEG data from general anaesthesia monitoring are rarely reused for research. Here, we explored repurposing EEG monitoring from general anaesthesia for brain-age modelling using machine learning. We hypothesised that brain age estimated from EEG during general anaesthesia is associated with perioperative risk.\n\n\nMethods\nWe reanalysed four-electrode EEGs of 323 patients under stable propofol or sevoflurane anaesthesia to study four EEG signatures (95% of EEG power &lt;8–13 Hz) for age prediction: total power, alpha-band power (8–13 Hz), power spectrum, and spatial patterns in frequency bands. We constructed age-prediction models from EEGs of a healthy reference group (ASA 1 or 2) during propofol anaesthesia. Although all signatures were informative, state-of-the-art age-prediction performance was unlocked by parsing spatial patterns across electrodes along the entire power spectrum (mean absolute error=8.2 yr; R2=0.65).\n\n\nResults\nClinical exploration in ASA 1 or 2 patients revealed that brain age was positively correlated with intraoperative burst suppression, a risk factor for general anaesthesia complications. Surprisingly, brain age was negatively correlated with burst suppression in patients with higher ASA scores, suggesting hidden confounders. Secondary analyses revealed that age-related EEG signatures were specific to propofol anaesthesia, reflected by limited model generalisation to anaesthesia maintained with sevoflurane.\n\n\nConclusions\nAlthough EEG from general anaesthesia may enable state-of-the-art age prediction, differences between anaesthetic drugs can impact the effectiveness and validity of brain-age models. To unleash the dormant potential of EEG monitoring for clinical research, larger datasets from heterogeneous populations with precisely documented drug dosage will be essential."

    "text": "(reprinted from the article: “bigger picture”)\nEstablishing standardized biomarkers of brain aging would have immense utility for quantifying the risks of adverse life outcomes, which may lead to more precise and personalized interventions. An increasingly common approach for deriving such biomarkers is to train machine-learning models on a diverse set of neuroimaging features with the goal of accurately estimating a person’s biological age. Further, the difference between biological and chronological ages has been shown to be a useful metric that is sensitive to many phenotypes. However, no definitive guidelines exist to help researchers decide which set of neural properties would improve model accuracy and utility. Accordingly, we conducted a systematic review of multimodal brain age studies to identify which neuroimaging features provided the largest added value. We found that the multimodal models had an increased capacity to predict age, which did not translate to widespread improvement in clinical utility."
