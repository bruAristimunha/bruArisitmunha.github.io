title: "About me"
---

üß† Exploring the intricacies of the human brain through electrophysiology, imaging, and machine learning is my passion. I channel this enthusiasm towards the development of biomarkers and next generation therapeutics. In my current role at Roche Pharma Research & Early Development in Basel, I orchestrate cross-functional expert teams within the dynamic framework of a matrix organization. I apply my expertise to assess the impact of novel compounds on brain dynamics and clinical outcomes, utilizing the knowledge, tools, and resources resulting of my extensive research journey.

üñ•Ô∏è ‚öô Previously, at Inria in Saclay-√éle-de-France/Paris, I pioneered machine learning approaches, developing innovative approaches to bridge the gap between the laboratory and the real-world applications.
