title: "About me"
---

üß† Exploring the intricacies of the human brain through electrophysiology, imaging, and machine learning is my passion. I channel this enthusiasm towards the development of biomarkers and next generation therapeutics. In my current role at Roche Pharma Research & Early Development in Basel, I orchestrate cross-functional expert teams within the dynamic framework of a matrix organization. I apply my expertise to assess the impact of novel compounds on brain dynamics and clinical outcomes, utilizing the knowledge, tools, and resources resulting of my extensive research journey.

üñ•Ô∏è ‚öô Previously, at Inria in Saclay-√éle-de-France/Paris, I pioneered machine learning approaches, developing innovative approaches to bridge the gap between the laboratory and the real-world applications.

üí° My diverse training and background in experimental psychology, neuroscience and machine learning is helping me to speak multiple scientific languages and helps me connecting (with) people working in distinct scientific areas.

üß≠ As an energetic scientist with a positive, creative, and solution-seeking mindset, I see leadership as a blend of listening, sharing, and caring. Beyond driving cutting-edge research, my passion lies in fostering personal and professional development, guiding individuals toward their goals. I truly believe in teams and their transformative energy and creativity.
